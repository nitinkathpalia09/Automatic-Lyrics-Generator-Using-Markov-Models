I'll be backstage after the show.
I'll be at the studio singing the song we wrote
About a girl you used to know.
It's a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won't you take me by the hand?
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I... I'm with you
I'm with you
Take me by the hand
Take me somewhere new
I don't know who you are
But I... I'm with you
I'm with you
Everythings changing when I turn around all out of my control I'm a mobile.
Everythings changing when I turn around all out of my control I'm a mobile.
Everythings changing when I turn around all out of my control I'm a mobile.
Everythings changing when I turn around all out of my control I'm a mobile.
Everythings changing
everywhere I go
All out of my control
Everythings changing
everywhere I go out of what I know
la la la la la la (la la)
la la la la la la (la la)
la la la la la la (la la la)
la la la la la la
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
You don't want me there
You just shut me out
You don't know me
Don't ignore me
If you had your way
You'd just shut me up
Make me go away
(That i'm so unwanted)
No, I just don't understand why
you won't talk to me
It hurts that I'm so unwanted for nothing
Don't talk words against me
I wanted to know you
I wanted to show you
I don't know how I'll feel,
tomorrow, tomorrow,
I don't know what to say,
tomorrow, tomorrow
Is a different day
It's always been up to you,
It's turning around,
It's up to me,
I'm gonna do what I have to do,
Gimme a little time,
Leave me alone a little while,
Maybe it's not too late,
not today, today, today, today, today...
Is it enough to love?
Is it enough to breathe?
Is it enough to die?
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please
I'd rather be anything but ordinary please.
If I could say what I want to say
I'd say I wanna blow you... away
Be with you every night
Am I squeezing you too tight
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down
On one knee
Marry me today
Guess, I’m wishing my life away
With these things I’ll never say
It don’t do me any good
It’s just a waste of time
What use is it to you
What’s on my mind
If it ain’t coming out
We’re not going anywhere
So why can’t I just tell you that I care
You know I always stay up without sleepin',
And think to myself,
Where do I belong forever,
In whose arms, the time and place?
Take some time,
Mellow out,
Party up,
But don't fall down,
Don't get caught,
Sneak out of the house.
I've seen enough and I'm over that
I'm not nobody's fool
If you wanna bring me down
Go ahead and try
Go ahead and try
Go ahead and try
Try and look me in the eye
But you'll never see inside
Until you realize, realize
Things are trying to settle down
Just try to figure out
Exactly what I'm about
If its with or without you
I don't need you doubting me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Can't find where i am
Lying here
Alone I fear
Afraid of the dark
No one to claim
Alone again
I'm naked
Around you
Does it show?
You see right through me
And I can't hide
I'm naked
Around you
And it feels so right
I'm naked
Oh oh yeah
Does it show?
Yeah, I'm naked
Oh oh, yeah yeah
All the pain I thought I knew
All the thoughts lead back to you
Back to what was never said
Back and forth inside my head
I can't handle this confusion
Come and take me away
Take me away
Break me away
Take me away
My heart is broken
I'm lying here
My thoughts are choking on you my dear
On you my dear
Don't try to tell me what to do,
Dont try to tell me what to say,
You're better off that way
I'll sit on my bed alone, staring at the phone.
He wasn't what I wanted, what I thought, no.
He wouldn't even open up the door.
He never made me feel like I was special.
He isn't really what I'm looking for.
Na na na na na, we've all got choices.
Na na na na, we've all got voices.
Na na na na na, stand up make some noise.
Na na na na, stand up make some noise.
It's nice to know that you were there
Thanks for acting like you cared
And making me feel like I was the only one
It's nice to know we had it all
Thanks for watching as I fall
And letting me know we were done
Let's talk this over
It's not like we're dead
Was it something I did?
Was it something you said?
Don't leave me hanging
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread
You were all the things I thought I knew
And I thought we could be
Her feelings she hides.
Her dreams she can't find.
She's losing her mind.
She's fallen behind.
She can't find her place.
She's losing her faith.
She's fallen from grace.
She's all over the place.
She's lost inside, lost inside...oh oh yeah
She's lost inside, lost inside...oh oh yeah
Have you forgotten
Everything that I wanted
Do you forget it now
You never got It
Do you get it now
Yea yea yea yea yea
Just freak out, let it go
I'm gonna live my life
I can't ever run and hide
I won't compromise
Cause I'll never know
I'm gonna close my eyes
I can't watch the time go by
I won't keep it inside
Freak out, let it go
Just freak out, let it go
Now you're gone, now you're gone
There you go, there you go
Somewhere I can't bring you back
Now you are gone, now you are gone
There you go, there you go,
Somewhere you're not coming back
I've had my wake up
Won't you wake up
I keep asking why
And I can't take it
It wasn't fake
And I don't wanna fall to pieces
I just want to sit and stare at you
I don't want to talk about it
And I don't want a conversation
I just want to cry in front of you
I don't want to talk about it
Cuz I'm in Love with you
Get me what I want
Everything I don't got
Get me what I want
Cause I'm a big shot
I'm thinking "What the hell?"
You say that I'm messing with your head
Boy, I like messing in your bed
Yeah, I am messing with your head
When I'm messing with you in bed
When you're gone
The pieces of my heart are missing you
When you're gone
The face I came to know is missing too
When you're gone
The words I need to hear to always get me through the day
And make it OK
I miss you
Say, won't you stay forever stay
If you stay forever hey
We can stay forever young
Oh whoa, oh whoa, here's to never growing up
Call it a bad attitude dude
I'm never gonna cover up that tattoo
I might have a couple issues
Rock 'n roll
Hey hey hey
Rock 'n roll
Hey hey hey
Rock 'n roll, yeah
We were on top of the world
Back when I was your girl
We were living so wild and free
Acting stupid for fun
All we needed was love
That's the way it's supposed to be
Seventeen
We were running red lights
We were going all night
Didn't care about anything
'Cause it was you and me
We were living our dream
And we were seventeen
It's gonna be a bitchin' summer,
We'll be livin' fast
Kickin' ass together
Like high school lovebirds
Gonna have a blast make it last forever
I'll pick you up at the liquor store
Hurry up, we can fit one more.
It's not enough, it's not enough
To give me what it is I want.
It's not enough, it's not enough
To get me everything I need.
And I, I wish it was.
I think it's time to give this up.
'Cause I'm for real
Are you for real?
I can't help myself
It's the way I feel
All this talking to you
I don't know what I'm to do
I don't know where you stand
What's inside of your head
Don't waste another day
Don't waste another minute
I can't wait to see your face
Just to show you how much I'm in it
Open up your heart
Help me understand
Please tell me who you are
So I can show you who I am
I like your smile
I like your vibe
I like your style
But that's not why I love you
Do you feel, do you feel me?
Do you feel what I feel, too?
La la
La la la la (oh oh)
La la
La la la (That's why I love you)
Wipe your eyes and put up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can
